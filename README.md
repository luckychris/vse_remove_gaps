This add-on removes all gaps in the VSE.
## ver 1.0
It is pretty dumb - it doesn't consider selections or anything else - it just deletes all gaps.
## ver 1.1
It now considers the strip selection: If you don't select any strip - it will use all strips. If you select strips, it will only consider the selected strips.
